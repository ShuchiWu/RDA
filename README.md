# Refine, Discriminate and Align: Stealing Encoders via Sample-Wise Prototypes and Multi-Relational Extraction

The official implementation of the paper "Refine, Discriminate and Align: Stealing Encoders via Sample-Wise Prototypes and Multi-Relational Extraction". Datasets (surrogate datasets + downstream datasets) and models (target encoders + surrogate encoders we trained) we use can be found at [dataset and code](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VV97lBVwt5rPlKSHtKQ8PjCuH7d1-fK-?usp=sharing).
